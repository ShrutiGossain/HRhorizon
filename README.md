HRHorizon is a comprehensive online platform designed to provide detailed insights into employee data within an organization. With two distinct interfaces catering to both users and administrators, HRHorizon offers a user-friendly experience for accessing and managing vital workforce information.

For users, HRHorizon offers a streamlined interface where they can securely log in to access a wealth of statistical information pertaining to the organization's workforce. This includes details such as the total number of employees, demographic breakdowns including age and gender ratios, attrition rates, and more. The platform presents this data in various formats, including reports, graphs, and charts, ensuring that users can easily digest and interpret the information for informed decision-making.

On the other hand, administrators are provided with a comprehensive suite of tools within the admin interface of HRHorizon. This allows them to not only view the same statistical data as users but also to make necessary changes or edits to the information as required. Whether updating employee records, modifying demographic data, or adjusting attrition metrics, administrators have the flexibility and control to manage workforce insights effectively.

One of the key strengths of HRHorizon lies in its emphasis on visual representation of data. By presenting information in the form of reports, graphs, and charts, the platform offers enhanced visualization capabilities, enabling users and administrators alike to gain deeper insights into workforce trends and patterns. This visual approach not only facilitates better understanding of the data but also aids in identifying areas for improvement and strategic decision-making.
